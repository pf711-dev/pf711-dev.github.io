今天，我在整理笔记的时候发现了这篇文章——是关于鼓励人们多去创造的话题——于是我又重读了一遍，发现我之前也写过类似主题的内容——《To Be a Creator》，更让我意外的是，我在一年前写的《让想法自然涌现》中也曾经提到过它，但我后来似乎一直都没有什么印象。

我对这种知识在大脑中如何生根发芽和并建立连接产生了兴趣，你很难想象这样的过程——它就像一颗种子，在你第一次读到的时候就在你的大脑里被种下了，但你似乎没有察觉，直到后来有了相似的经历或者体验，给予它浇灌，它才生根发芽，并最终让你有所行动。

我也突然也意识到，我开始尝试公开写些东西或多或少也是受它的启发。

这篇文章作者的写作风格非常生活化，读起来很舒服。内容主要记录了他是如何意识到自己大部分时间都在消费，并转变为一个创造者的经历。我尝试用工具将它翻译成中英对照，并稍加校对，分享一下，希望对大家也能有所启发。

Consume less, create more | 少消费，多创造

Like most people, I like to sit on the bus, stare out at the zombies drooling over their phones, and feel smugly superior. I see their bored, lifeless eyes and pity these sheeple whose lives have been ruined in service of Big Tech profits. 

像大多数人一样，我喜欢坐在公共汽车上，盯着那些对着手机流口水的僵尸，沾沾自喜。我看到他们无聊、死气沉沉的眼睛，我很同情这些为科技巨头的利润服务而毁了生活的人。

This lasts for about thirty seconds before I get bored. The guy next to me chuckles at something on Kanye’s Twitter feed. Wait Kanye? I thought he was off Twitter! In seconds my own phone is out, and I’m furiously scrolling through Reddit, looking for fresh memes. 

这持续了大约 30 秒，然后我就会感到无聊。我旁边的人对 Kanye 的 Twitter 提要上的内容咯咯笑。等等，Kanye？我以为他不在 Twitter 上了！几秒钟后，我自己的手机就掉了，我疯狂地浏览 Reddit，寻找新鲜的新闻。

And so goes the common trope: we all hate our phones, social media, and Netlfix—but we also love them. 

常见的比喻也是如此：我们都讨厌我们的手机、社交媒体和 Netlfix——但我们也喜欢它们。

Eventually tiring of plain-vanilla bus-ride superiority, I brought a book with me on the bus. Not a Kindle, or an iPad, but a bona fide bound book. 

最后，我厌倦了乘坐公交车时那种平淡无奇的优越感，于是带上了一本书。不是 Kindle，也不是 iPad，而是一本真正的精装书。

After every sentence or two I would gaze incredulously around the bus with a sneaky grin. These dumb cows, I thought, look at them melt their brains with their stupid social feeds. They can’t focus like I can. I was about to turn back to Sapiens when I noticed a woman in the back of the bus who wasn’t staring at her phone. Nor was she reading a book. She wasn’t even listening to a monotonous NPR podcast.

每说一两句话，我就会带着狡黠的笑容，怀疑地环顾公共汽车。我想，这些愚蠢的奶牛，看看他们用愚蠢的社交饲料融化了他们的大脑。他们不能像我一样专注。我正要转回《智人》，这时我注意到公共汽车后排的一位女士没有盯着手机看。她也没有看书。她甚至没有在听单调的 NPR 广播。

This psychopath was sketching . She had a charcoal pencil and was sketching a human figure. She didn’t look happy exactly. But she looked engaged. She looked intent. And all of a sudden my smugness fled. I realized that reading a book was really just like reading Reddit—both were consumptive activitives. 

这个变态在画素描。她拿着一支炭笔，正在画一个人的素描。她看上去并不开心。但她看上去很忙。她看上去很专心。突然间，我的自鸣得意消失了。我意识到读书就像浏览 Reddit 一样——两者都是消费活动。

Were previous generations really better off because they merely watched TV, or listened to radio, or read books? All of these activities are passive. All of these activities involve letting external thoughts temporarily replace your own. Today’s smartphones differ from medieval books only in degree—all media is created to be consumed.

前几代人真的因为看电视、听广播或读书而过得更好吗?所有这些活动都是被动的。所有这些活动都涉及到让外在的想法暂时取代你自己的想法。今天的智能手机与中世纪的书籍只在程度上有所不同——所有的媒体都是为了消费而创造的。

I had to start creating. 

我不得不开始创作。

Corín Tellado was a Spanish author who wrote over 5,000 books in her 81-year lifespan. That’s over sixty books a year, assuming she came out of the womb fully literate. She claimed she could write a book in two days, and I’m inclined to believe her. 

Corín Tellado 是一位西班牙作家，在她 81 岁的一生中写了 5000 多本书。假设她从娘胎里出来就完全识字的话，一年就能写六十多本书。她声称她可以在两天内写一本书，我倾向于相信她。

I can’t write a tweet in two days. Nevertheless, I was inspired by Tellado to stop consuming and start creating. If we categorize all our waking moments as either consumptive or creative, I was probably at a 10:1 ratio, and that’s only if I label “copy/pasting stock images into Keynote presentations” as “creative.” Tellado was probably closer to 1:1. How could I get closer to that? 

我两天写不出一条推特。尽管如此，我还是受到 Tellado 的启发，停止消费，开始创造。如果我们把所有醒着的时刻都归类为消费和创造，我的比例可能是10:1，而且这只是在我把“复制/粘贴库存图片到 Keynote 演讲中”标记为“创造性”的情况下。Tellado 的比例可能接近1:1。我怎么能更接近那个呢?

On my next bus ride I pulled out my phone and opened the iOS notes app. I created a new note titled Essay . 
下次坐公交车时，我拿出手机，打开iOS笔记应用。我创建了一个名为“随笔”的新笔记。

I stared at that off-white screen for several long minutes without typing anything. I don’t have anything to write about, I thought. Also, I’m not even a good writer…maybe I should look online for some tips… 

我盯着那块灰白色的屏幕看了好几分钟，什么也没写出来。我没有什么可写的，我想。而且，我甚至不是一个好作家，也许我应该在网上找一些技巧...

But that was a bad idea and I knew it. So I swallowed my pride and just started writing: 

但我知道这是个坏主意。所以我放下自尊，开始写:

Why I think creating stuff is a good thing. 

为什么我认为创造东西是一件好事。

An essay by Tom C. 

Tom C 所著

This was going to be rough. 

整个过程很艰难。

I think people consume too much, and don’t create enough. This is bad I think. 

我认为人们消费得太多，而创造得太少。我认为这很糟糕。

Like, really rough.  

真的很艰难。

But I kept typing; pouring inane, kindergarten-level drivel into my phone. 

但我一直在打字;往我手机里灌幼儿园水平的废话。

The average person can type about 20 words per minute on a phone. My commute is about 30 minutes each way, so that’s a maximum of 1,200 words a day. Realistically I’m going to have to spend some time thinking about what to write, so let’s be conservative and shoot for 500 words a day. 

一般人在手机上每分钟可以打 20 个单词。我的上下班时间大约是 30 分钟，所以每天最多写 1200 个单词。实际上，我将不得不花一些时间考虑写什么，所以让我们保守一点，每天写 500 字。

I read somewhere that a good blog post is 1,600 words…so if I work fast I could pump one out every three days, right? 

我在某个地方读到一篇好的博客文章有1600字，所以如果我工作速度快，我可以每三天写一篇，对吧?

The first day I wrote 100 horrible words. Really super bad. No one will ever see these words.

第一天我写了 100 个可怕的字。真的非常糟糕。没有人会看到这些字。

Day two I wrote 80 words. I think I psyched myself out over how bad the previous day went. 

第二天我写了 80 字。我想我是被前一天的糟糕情况吓到了。

The third day I only kept writing out of stubbornness. I knew this project was doomed, but I felt like really dooming it.

第三天，我只是固执地继续写。我知道这个项目注定要失败，但我真的想让它完蛋。

By then end of the first week I had 500 words in the bank. I didn’t feel good about it, but it felt slightly better than scrolling through 47 #AndThatsWhyYouAreMyEx tweets. 

到第一周结束时，我已经积累了 500 个单词了。我感觉不太好，但比浏览47条 #AndThatsWhyYouAreMyEx 的推特要好一点。

My essay was garbage. But it was my garbage. 

我的文章是垃圾。但那是我自己的垃圾。

So I kept at it, day after day. I once again started feeling smugly superior to my fellow bus riders. Look at me creating , I thought. Look at me contributing to the world, while these reptiles just distract themselves with their phones until they die. 

所以我坚持了下来，日复一日。我又开始沾沾自喜地觉得自己比其他公交乘客优越。看看我在创作，我想。看看我对世界的贡献，而这些爬行动物只是用手机分散自己的注意力，直到他们死去。

This arrogance lasts for a few seconds until I re-read the stream-of-consciousness dogshit I’m typing into my phone. 

这种傲慢持续了几秒钟，直到我重新阅读我正在手机里输入的意识流。

I’ve never done sales, but I know a little bit about the “sales funnel.” You hire college grads to make 500 cold calls in a week. Of those 500 calls, maybe 5% agree to watch a demo of the product. Then some slightly-more-senior sales people do this demo, and perhaps 20% of those demos end up in contract negotiation. And 60% of those end up as actual sales. That means you need 500 cold calls to make three sales. 

我从未做过销售，但我对“销售漏斗”略知一二。你雇大学毕业生一周打 500 个陌生电话。在这 500 个电话中，可能有 5% 的人同意观看产品的演示。然后一些稍微高级一点的销售人员做这个演示，也许 20% 的演示最终会在合同谈判中结束。其中 60% 最终成为实际销售额。这意味着你需要 500 个陌生电话才能做成 3 笔生意。

I think that’s what creating is like. You need to write 500 words to get three good ones. Or 500 sketches, business ideas, or recipes. If you’re really really good, you can increase your overall conversion rate from 0.6% to 1%—but the most reliable way to get better results is to just produce more crap. 

我认为这就是创作的样子。你需要写 500 个字才能得到三个好字。或者 500 张草图、商业创意或食谱。如果你真的很好，你可以将你的整体转化率从 0.6% 提高到 1%——但获得更好的结果的最可靠方法是产生更多的废话。

So I kept at it. week after week. Sometime in the middle of the fourth week I had 3,000 words in my Notes app. That’s when I started editing. 

所以我坚持了下来。一周又一周。在第四周的某个时候，我的笔记应用程序中有 3000 个单词。那时我开始编辑。

Editing is hard because you realize how bad you are. But editing is easy because we’re all better at criticizing than we are at creating. 

编辑很难，因为你意识到自己有多糟糕。但编辑很容易，因为我们都更擅长批评，而不是创造。

The good thing about forcing yourself to produce a bunch of garbage is that you don’t feel bad deleting it. You’re not married to any of your work, because you wrote it half-awake on the 1BX while some crazy dude negotiated his fare with the driver. I gleefully deleted hundreds of words, trying not to think about the neanderthal who must’ve written them. 

强迫自己生成一堆垃圾的好处是，删除它们不会让你感觉不好。你没有和你的任何作品结婚，因为你是在某个疯子和司机谈车费的时候半醒着在 1BX 上写的。我高兴地删掉了几百个字，尽量不去想写这些字的那个尼安德特人。

It was exactly a month after I started this creative project that I finished this first essay. I read it over for the bazillionth time and thought this only a small tire fire .

就在我开始这个创意项目一个月后，我完成了第一篇论文。我把它读了无数遍，以为这只是一个小轮胎起火。

In it’s final form, the essay was almost exactly 1,600 words. I called it Consume less, create more . 

这篇文章的最终定稿将近1600字。我称之为《少消费，多创造》。

You are, in fact, reading that essay right now. It may not look like it, but this is the product of an entire month of bus rides. If you live in San Francisco and saw someone on the 1BX smashing the face of his phone like he was angry at it, you probably saw me writing this essay. 

事实上，你现在正在读那篇文章。也许看起来不像，但这是整整一个月坐公交车的结果。如果你住在旧金山，看到有人在 1BX 上砸他的手机，好像他很生气，你可能看到我在写这篇文章。

Perhaps three people will read this essay, including my parents. Despite that, I feel an immense sense of accomplishment. I’ve been sitting on buses for years, but I have more to show for my last month of bus rides than the rest of that time combined. 

也许有三个人会读这篇文章，包括我的父母。尽管如此，我还是有一种巨大的成就感。我坐公共汽车已经好几年了，但我最后一个月坐公共汽车的次数比其他时间加起来还要多。

Smartphones, I’ve decided, are not evil. This entire essay was composed on an iPhone. What’s evil is passive consumption, in all its forms. 

我认为智能手机并不邪恶。这篇文章是用 iPhone 写的。邪恶的是各种形式的被动消费。

Twitter, Facebook, Instagram—we can all agree that these are serious timewasters. But what about The Economist or War and Peace ? How much can you really remember from all of those New York Times op-eds you’ve read? Could you summarize the major themes of Grapes of Wrath ? 

Twitter、Facebook、Instagram——我们都同意这些都是严重浪费时间的东西。但是《经济学人》或者《战争与和平》呢?从你读过的《纽约时报》专栏中，你能真正记住多少?你能概括一下《愤怒的葡萄》的主题吗?

Most knowledge worth having comes from practice . It comes from doing . It comes from creating . Reading about the trade war with China doesn’t make you smarter—it gives you something to say at dinner parties. It gives you the illusion that you have the vaguest idea what is happening in our enormously complex world. 

大多数值得拥有的知识来自实践。它来自于行动。它来自于创造。阅读与中国的贸易战不会让你变得更聪明——它只会让你在晚宴上有话可说。它给你一种错觉，以为你对我们这个极其复杂的世界里正在发生的事情有了最模糊的了解。

A lot of ink has been spilled about the perils of modern technology. How it distracts us, how it promotes unhealthy comparisons with others, how it makes us fat, how it limits social interaction, how it spies on us. And all of these things are probably true, to some extent. 

关于现代科技的危险，人们已经写了很多文章。它是如何让我们分心的，它是如何促使我们与他人进行不健康的比较的，它是如何让我们变胖的，它是如何限制社会互动的，它是如何监视我们的。在某种程度上，所有这些都可能是正确的。

But the real tragedy of modern technology is that it’s turned us into consumers . Our voracious consumption of media parallels our consumption of fossil fuels, corn syrup, and plastic straws. And although we’re starting to worry about our consumption of those physical goods, we seem less concerned about our consumption of information.

但现代科技真正的悲剧在于它把我们变成了消费者。我们对媒体的贪婪消费与对化石燃料、玉米糖浆和塑料吸管的消费不相上下。尽管我们开始担心我们对这些实物商品的消费，但我们似乎不太关心我们对信息的消费。

We treat information as necessarily good, and comfort ourselves with the feeling that whatever article or newsletter we waste our time with is actually good for us. We equate reading with self improvement , even though we forget most of what we’ve read, and what we remember isn’t useful. 

我们认为信息一定是好的，并安慰自己，我们浪费时间看的文章或时事通讯实际上对我们有好处。我们把阅读等同于自我提升，即使我们忘记了大部分读过的东西，记住的东西也没有用。

So stop reading and start creating . Paint, draw, compose, code, or plan. It will be hard. It will be slow. It will be frustrating. But I promise it will be worth it. 

所以停止阅读，开始创作吧。绘画，绘制，撰写，编码或计划。这将很难。这将是缓慢的。这将令人沮丧。但我保证这一切都是值得的。
